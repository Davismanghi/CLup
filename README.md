# CLup
CLup â€“ Customers Line-up is an intuitive and essential application designed to address the challenges posed by overcrowding in stores during healthcare emergencies. On one hand, it empowers store managers to efficiently regulate the flow of customers within their establishments. On the other hand, it offers customers a hassle-free alternative to queuing for extended periods outdoors.

It has been done as project in my course of Software Enginering 2, where we have presented its Requirement Analysis and Specification Document and Design Document, but not its implementation.

Key Features:

Digital Queue Management:

Mode 1: Enables customers to obtain a virtual queue number from any location and patiently wait until their turn or proximity to it before heading to the store.
Additionally, the app facilitates the generation of QR codes for customers, ensuring seamless entry and allowing store managers to monitor and manage foot traffic effectively.

Appointment Booking:

Mode 2: Provides real-time queue management while also offering customers the option to schedule appointments for their supermarket visits. Customers can specify their expected duration, or for regular patrons, the system can predict visit durations based on historical data analysis.

Fallback Options:

Mode 3: Recognizes the need to accommodate customers who may not have access to the necessary technology. Stores can issue physical tickets on-site, acting as proxies for those customers, ensuring inclusion for all.

Enhanced User Experience:

The CLup app goes beyond queue management, allowing users to suggest alternative time slots or days for store visits.
Recommends alternative stores within the same chain if the preferred location is unavailable.
Notifies users of available slots within a specific time range, further enhancing their shopping convenience.

In summary, CLup revolutionizes the shopping experience by mitigating overcrowding risks, simplifying queuing processes, and enhancing overall customer satisfaction.
